# News-Search-Tool

This is a tool I created in December of 2024. It is a way to get the full picture of reporting on a topic across 64 mainstream news sites. The "bias" judgments are based on the AllSides Media Bias Chart found [here]([url](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart)). I used this project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Certain embedded features are left inactive due to the limitation of NewsAPI's free plan.
